The wunderground API we used is no longer the same. It is now paid and under a different service.

With that said, I will be updating this project in the near future to use the Openweathermap API. Here is the URL...

https://www.openweathermap.org/api

It is similar and if you want to attempt the project using the same core principles and functionality using this different API, it may even help you understand things more. If not, sit tight and I will update the project as soon as I get the chance.
